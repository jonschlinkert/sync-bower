> Sync package.json with bower.json.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save sync-bower
```

### API

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var sync = require('sync-bower');
var pkg = require('./package.json');
var bower = require('./bower.json');

var updatedBower = sync(pkg, bower);

fs.writeFile('bower.json', updatedBower, function(err) {
  if (err) console.log(err);
});
```

## CLI

Run `sync-bower` in the command line to update bower.json.

```sh
$ sync-bower
```

* If `bower.json` exists, it will be updated with values in package.json.
* If `bower.json` does not exist, you will be asked if you want to create one.

### Commands

```sh
$ sync-bower bower
```

#### diff

See a visual diff of proposed changes between package.json and bower.json. Does not modify any files.

```sh
